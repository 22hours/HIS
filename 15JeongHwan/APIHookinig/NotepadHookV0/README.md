## NOTEPAD HOOKING PROGRAM

Ver.0
---

### What is this?

When you Run it your keyboard input that you type in your notepad ( window standard application ) is all ignored 

If you want to quit this just type 'q' or 'Q' or Kill the process

This is consist of Cpp & Dll (both written by C++) use WINAPI Hooking ("user32.dll")

Beacause we must need that the control it's like stop about your keyboard input in your notepad
